    <h2>Intallation</h2>

    <p>Some components, such as custom objects, custom report types, and workflow rules, must be activated using the package deploy process,
     before they are available to your organization.</p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>Add some Team Members in this new application.</p>
    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <p>This is a <b>managed package (paquet manag√©).</b> While you code in you favorit IDE you will not be able to upload its custom sObject.
    Visual Studio Code does not alow it. But you can work localy without havig the sObject implementation localy. Basicaly it means you will
    have to run your tests from de Saleforce Developpers Console.
    </p>
    <h2>Major BUG</h2>
    <p>Imediataly after installing your new app, creating a new record on sObject agf__ADM_Work__c, will be impossible. It is due to an 
        endless loop in the creation procees of a new reccord on agf__ADM_Work__c. A new record Work needs a 'Product Tag', which needs a Team.
        And a Team needs at least two Team Membesr to exist.
    </p>
    <p>Work &#8592; Product Tag &#8592; Team &#8592;&#8594; 2 Team Members &#8592; Users</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 Teams Members</li>
