    <h1>Milliseconds</h1>
    <p>For this project you've got more than one possiblity to count days. The chosen one was to calculate a day as a number of 
      hours within the Business Hours. At Modis, the day of work starts at 9h and ends at 17h30. This is legal terms. A day of 
      work is 8,5 hours long ; or 8:30 long ; or 30 600 000 milliseconds long.
      Business Hours, as Holiday is a native sObjet on your organisation.</p>
    <p>You could mabe, use the folowing table to create custom meta data for 
      this project.Use the folowing link : <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custommetadatatypes_overview.htm&type=5">
      Salesforce</a>. The curent version of this project declare theese values as CONSTANTS in the class : UTIL_Duration.cls.</p>
      <h2><b>WARNING</b></h2>
      <p>If you changes these values in UTIL_Duration.cls it will change the way you mesure time.</p>
      <p>If you change information on the sObject agf__ADM_User_Business_Hours__c, make sure that it matches the info on UTIL_Duration.cls as well.
        The two are not linked and linking the two would be a great upgrade.</p>
